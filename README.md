# Hue-Control
A desktop application for controlling Hue Smart Lights

# Preface
While this project could have uses to others, I'm currently writing it as a way to become more proficient with web technologies. At the moment, I'm not planning on making the code compatible with every users setup. Once I become proficient, I will come back and re-write the project with compatibility in mind.

## TODO
* Scrap everything and re-write it (especially the CSS)

## Bugs
* Jittering for the scroll bar
